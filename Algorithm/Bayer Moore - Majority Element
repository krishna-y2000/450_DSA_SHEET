Bayer Moore Voting Algorithm : 
-> It is used to find the majority element in the array 
-> Approach : 
1) Take count = 0 ( it will take count of majority element  )
2) make arr[0] has majority
3) Iterate all the element 
    -> if arr[i] != maj_ele -> count--
    -> if count = 0 , make current element as maj_ele and count = 1 
4) We will get the majority element from above but it can still not statisfy the condition 
    so check if count > N/2 then true else return false
